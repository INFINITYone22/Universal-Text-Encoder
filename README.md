# Universal Text Encoder Project

## Overview

This project introduces a single, universal text encoder designed as a global standard for generating rich language embeddings in multimodal AI applications, such as text-to-image and text-to-video generation. It uses character-level tokenization to capture detailed semantics across all world languages, ensuring bias-free and consistent representations.

## Short Description

The encoder is a deep Transformer model (32 layers, 4096-dimensional embeddings) optimized for efficiency with FP8 precision. It runs on datacenters managed by service providers, processing user prompts and delivering compact embeddings via SafeTensors format to edge devices. This offloads heavy computation from users while enabling high-quality, universal text understanding for local AI models.

## Key Features
- **Character-Level Tokenization**: Vocabulary of 4096 tokens covering global scripts, with smart space normalization for efficiency.
- **Deep Architecture**: 32 Transformer layers for hierarchical semantic capture.
- **Deployment Model**: Datacenter-based service providing embeddings to edge devices, reducing local compute needs.
- **Universality**: Supports any language, promoting a standard for multimodal AI.
